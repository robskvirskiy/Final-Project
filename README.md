For my Final Project, I made my own version of a Pong game that I found off of YouTube. I made a Philadelphia Eagles Style Pong game, where one player is the Eagles, and the other player is the Cowboys. I used the original code that was provided, but changed things in the code as well. Among the things I changed, are the title, paddle colors, the paddles positions, ball color, ball shape, ball speed, scoreboard color, scoreboard title, scoreboard font, scoreboard font size, took the sound off, and lastly changed the code on the bottom for the score code to say what I had for the scoreboard on the previous code.
